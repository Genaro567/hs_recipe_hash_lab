#code your solutions here

#1. Create a hash called `mac_and_cheese_recipe` that has the following data:
#  - elbow pasta - 2 cups
#  - butter - 1/2 stick
#  - whole milk - 1 cup
#  - shredded cheddar cheese - 3 cups
# All of the ingredients should be symbols and the amounts should be strings. Remember that symbols start with a colon and be sure to sub underscores for spaces.

mac_and_cheese_recipe = {
  
  
  }


#2: Write code that returns the amount of cheese from mac_and_cheese ingredients that is needed in the recipe.
def amount_of_cheese(any_recipe)

end

#3: Use `puts` to print out every ingredient and amount in the hash by iterating through the collection. You'll want to use the `each` method.
def ingredients_and_amounts(any_recipe)
 
end

#4: Now use `puts` to print out just the ingredients without the amounts. You'll want to use the `each_key` method.
def ingredients(any_recipe)
 
end

#5: Now use `puts` to print out just the amounts without the ingredients. You'll want to use the `each_value` method.
def amounts(any_recipe)

end

#6: Return the number of ingredients in the `mac_and_cheese_recipe` hash.
def number_ingredients(any_recipe)

end
